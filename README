The functions in data.c are used to encrypt and decrypt the main
DATA.BIN file stored on the UMD. The cipher tables in these files were
taken from Monster Hunter Portable 3rd but they also work for Monster
Hunter Freedom Unite. There's an example of how to decrypt the
DATA.BIN in the data_example.c file.

The functions in quest.c are used to encrypt and decrypt the event
quest files downloaded from within the game. The keys in these files
were taken form Monster Hunter Portable 3rd and I have not tested them
with any other version of the game. There's an example of how to
decrypt a quest file in the quest_example.c file.

The download.py file can be used to download pages and files from the
Monster Hunter Portable 3rd event quest server. It requires Python 2.7
to run.

The functions in savedata.c are used to encrypt and decrypt the save
data. The cipher tables in these files were take from Monster Hunter
Portable 3rd and will only work with unencrypted PSP save data from
that game. There's an example of how to decrypt some save data in the
savedata_example.c file.
