You can install the package like this:
  python setup.py install

The example scripts in the examples folder show how to use each of the
encryption classes.

The download scripts in the tools folder can be used to download the encrypted
DLC files from the DLC servers.

The DLC servers for PSP games uses normal HTML pages and the index page is
called "DL_TOP.PHP". The pages themselves will be in plain text but the quest
files will be encrypted.

The DLC servers for the 3DS use text files that don't really provide obvious
links to each other. Every file on the 3DS DLC servers is encrypted. It's
easiest start with the file called "DLC_EventQuestInfo_eng.txt", which will
list the IDs for the event quest files. The 60xxx number is the ID which you
can use to find the encrypted quest file. For instance if the ID is 60001 you
would want to download the file called "m60001.mib"
